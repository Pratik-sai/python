data types : str, int, float, double
data structures: list, dict, set, tuple,

li =[1,2,3]
li = list(1,2,3)

di = {"key":"value", "key2": "value"}
di = {1:"a", "b":2}
di = dict(a=1) # {"a": 1}
key = int, str, tuple
value = int, str, tuple, list, dict

* division always gives floating value
  e.g: 8/4 = 2.0
       7/2 = 3.5
  for integer value we have to use "//"
  e.g: 8//4 = 2
       7//2 = 3
* power = "**"
* reminder = '%'
* "=" used to value a variable
* "==" used to compare variable
* '...' or "..." = manipulate string 
* (\') = to escape single quote
* \n = newline    #without print() \n include in the output
* "r" =  If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters
  e.g: print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
       print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
* """...""" or '''...''' = span multiple lines 
* "+" add strings
  e.g: str + ing
	'string'
* "*" repeated strings
* slicing
	[0:2] = position 0 to 2
	[:2] = from the beginning to posion 2
	[2:] = from posion 2 to the end
	[-2:] = second last to the end 
* len() = length of string or list
* (end=' ') = avoid newline
* range() = to iterate over a sequence of number
	#range(start,end,steps)
* break = end the loop
* continue = skip the loop
* pass = when the user does not know what to write (for not to show error in the execution) 

	*args allows for any number of optional positional arguments (parameters), which will be assigned to a tuple named args.

	**kwargs allows for any number of optional keyword arguments (parameters), which will be in a dict named kwargs.

   "*" is used to get all the elemant from list
	e.g: l =[1,2,3,4,5]
	     print(l)
	     print(*l)
	output:
	     [1,2,3,4,5]
	     1 2 3 4 5


   "%" is used to format elemant from list
	e.g: exam_date = (24, 11, 2021)
	     print("the date of exam is : %i / %i / %i " % exam_date)
	output:
	     the date of exam is : 24 / 11 / 2021

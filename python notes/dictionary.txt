			DICTIONARY

-> it is a collection of python, which works on key and value pair
-> Follows the ordered container or collection
-> Dictionary ha immutable key and value could be immutable and mutable both which depends upon what value you are storing
->same values cannot be store in same keys 
->If we use the square brackets [], KeyError is raised in case a key is not found in the dictionary. On the other hand, the get() method returns None if the key is not found.
->{key1:value1,key2:value2,...}
->		LIST INTO DICTIONARY STORE
   d1 = {1:"pyton", 2:"java","animal":["lion, "tiger", "wolf"]}
->		TUPLE INTO DICTIONARY STORE
   d2 = {1:"pyton", 2:"java","animal":("lion, "tiger", "wolf")}
->dictionary.get(key)     	FOR ACCESSING THE VALUE
->d.items()			WRITTENS TUPLE INTO A LIST
->d.update({key:value})           update the dictionary
			REMOVE THE ITEM
->d.pop(key)	KEY VALUE IS COMPULSORY
->d.popitem	REMOVE LAST ITEM
->del d[key]	remove
->d.clear()     clear the dictionary
		ACCESS ONLY KEYS
->d.keys()	
		ACCESS ONLY VALUES
->d.values()

    					DEFAULTDICT
-> It's a subsection of dictionary
->if key is not presant in the dictionary it doesn't excute error but returns the default value
e.g:- 	def def_value():			output:-1
    	return "Not Present"				2
     							Not Present
	# Defining the dict				
	d = defaultdict(def_value)
	d["a"] = 1
	d["b"] = 2
 
	print(d["a"])
	print(d["b"])
	print(d["c"])

					SET

->A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).

However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.

->A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma, or by using the built-in set() function.

->set cannot have mutable items

e.g- my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}
output : {1, 2, 3, 4}

e.g:
my_set = {1, 3}
my_set.add(2)
my_set.update([2, 3, 4])
my_set.update([4, 5], {1, 6, 8})

output:	{1, 3}
	{1, 2, 3}
	{1, 2, 3, 4}
	{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

difference between discard() and remove():

discard(): remove items and does not show error even if the item is not in the set
remove() : remove items and shows error if the item is not in the set


  		SET OPERATION
A|B : UNION      		A.UNION(B) OR B.UNION(A)
A&B : INTERSECTION		A.INTERSECTION(B) OR B.INTERSECTION(A)
A-B : DIFFERENCE		A.DIFFERENCE(B) AND B.DIFFERENCE(A)
A^B : SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE	A.SYMMETRIC_DIFFERENCE(B) OR B.SYMMETRIC_DIFFERENCE(A)

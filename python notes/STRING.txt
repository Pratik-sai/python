*** THE STR.INDEX() & STR.FIND() BOTH ARE SIMLILAR FUNCTION BUT THE DIFFERNCE IS FIND() METHOD RETURNS -1 IF THE SUBSTRING IS NOT FOUND WHEREAS INDEX() SHOWS AN EXCEPTION ***

*** DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ISDIGIT() & ISNUMERIC()
 Similarly, roman numerals, currency numerators and fractions are considered numeric numbers (usually written using unicode) but not decimals. The isdecimal() also returns False in this case.***

*** Difference between str.find() & str.rfind() is str.find() returns first occurance index of substring while str.rfind returns highest index of substring if the substring is not presant it returns -1 *** 

*** The format_map(mapping) is similar to str.format(**mapping) method.

The only difference is that str.format(**mapping) copies the dict whereas str.format_map(mapping) makes a new dictionary during method call. This can be useful if you are working with a dict subclass.***

***format_map(mapping) is more flexible than format(**mapping) as you can have missing keys.***s
